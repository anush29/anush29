    <h1> Why Anush should go to Discovery High School</h1>
    <p>
        6.75 credits are standard at Discovery HS while on the other hand, you only get 6 credits each year at Camas HS at max.
        Discovery HS includes AP classes that are maditory for everyone in the school (making everyone learn the same subject to discuss on), and will offer more AP classes for the 2019-2020 year of Freshmen and Sophomores.
        Discovery HS includes Fabrication Lab, Music Editing, Robotics and more interesting electives that are useful for college years and jobs.
        The fact that it allows you to do personal projects will give you a better understanding of your future career path but it also gives you further connections with companies because you have to connect with certain companies for a project.
        Also working in a Project Based Learning environment will look good on a college resume because of the amount of projects with people you will have to do will give you good people skills.
        They have a really good lab for building things that are industrial in worthiness.
        Teachers are less demanded throughout the school because comparing the options, 2,901 kids compared to 263 students enrolled next year. You have more personal time with teachers.
        The science labs are fully equipped
        You would be better at public speaking because for your projects, you will be forced to have to explain things.
        The campus is equipped with a variety of technologically advanced items. It is more like a private school.
        The food is 10x better that other Camas schools.
        A smaller class size means more student attention and you will have a better chance of achieving better.
        The schedule is 5 minutes longer than other Camas schools.
        12 students from Anush’s Homeroom class are attending Discovery HS
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are some of Anush's friends and Teachers thoughts on him going to Discovery HS:
        <br>
        Reagan (the really smart person) from Anush’s class (who is going to Discovery) says: “I believe Anush should go to Discovery because it essential for his future in better paying career fields”
        <br>
        Sam from Anush’s class (who is going to Discovery) says: “Anush should go because PBL is a place for, an open environment and more stuff”
        <br>
        Natalie from Anush’s class (who is going to Discovery) says:"Since the classes are smaller, you can learn better."
        <br>
        Griffin from Anush’s class (who is going to Discovery) says:”It is a really good place and the facility gives you reminders of college life.”
        <br>
        Mrs. Rivas says: There are a number of reasons why Anush should go to Discovery. Anush is brilliant, motivated, and hard-working. However, he is quiet and reserved. At Discovery, Anush will have small class sizes which will afford Anush more opportunities to participate in class discussions. He will also have more projects which will engage Anush’s excellent critical thinking. Discovery has lower student-to-faculty ratios, so Anush will have more opportunities to process his future with his teachers.
        <br>
        Mr. Dewey says: Anush is a self-motivated student who has expressed his desire to work on Architecture and design. A School like discovery would be a perfect place for him to develop his talents and provide an example of what PBL success looks like.
        <br>
        <br>
        Notable Points about PBL and other things:
Deeper learning. PBL leads to deeper understanding and greater retention of content knowledge. 
Improves public speaking skills because you work in groups and present many projects.
A private school that no one else will get accepted in
Creativity and technology.
Less time on screens (because you will be working with groups having discussions)
Projects require students to be active meaning you will have HW
(At CHS info meeting for students, one of the FAQ’s was, “do you get a lot of homework?” One of the high school students who answered the question said: You do all of you homework at school or you get very little to do at home. She also mentioned homework loads will be similar to middle school (which is none). Also during the other orientation meeting for student AND parents, they kept repeatedly saying that the amount of homework you get “depends on the teacher” which makes me think they are hiding the fact from parents that there will be NO homework. Discovery on the other hand said during the student info meeting that it will be challenging because there will be a regular amount of about 2 hours of homework each day.)
<br>
<br>
My librarian said that Discovery HS will offer more classes next year because so many students have enrolled for the 2019-2020 year fresh Freshman and Sophomores. They will send a survey asking what new classes people are interested in and will accommodate based on student interest.
Discovery may be new but it will be more experienced next year to the point of Camas HIgh School because discovery still has the reputation of CAMAS School DIstrict (117) and there all of the teachers there are very experienced. Discovery even has a good reputation right now because it has popped up several times in the news with positive feedback and saying that all the students there are good “innovators.” Discovery HS has popped up on newspapers such as the Columbian, Camas Post Record and other places. Many of Anush’s teachers also say it is a great example of PBL success for students like Anush who have very creative brains and like to have a smarter, willing-to-hard-work class.
Discovery has ZERO drug abuse because of the smaller class sizes and school size. It is safer and everything stays in order. Everyone is like family at Discovery and every teacher in the building knows everyone by heart. They make sure you are not abusing drugs and other bad things that can harm you. On the other hand, Camas High School has had TONS of drug abuse cases. My health teacher says he know 3 students that he taught that died because of overdose on drugs. There have been many suicides there. Neha said she saw a girl some months ago come into school drunk and pass out. 
Sam, Reagan, Some other of Sam’s friends, and I plan to start an art club if there is student interest at Discovery HS (If I am able to go to Discovery). Discovery allows people to start clubs of their choice if there is student interest and teacher/administration approval.
All of the teachers at Discovery HS are very experienced. Since it is a new school, all of the teachers and Administration who work there are all experienced teachers who have worked at other Camas schools before. I know 4 teachers there already. Examples:
Librarian at DHS - My librarian at Liberty MS (Mrs. Rivas) said that she knows the librarian at Discovery HS. She said that the librarian has 12 years experience. My librarian actually got the offer to work at DHS but she could not get the job because the other librarian had so much experience.
Vice Principal at DHS - The Vice Principal at DHS right now (Mrs. O’Rourke) used to work at Liberty MS. She worked at Liberty MS since it opened in 2006 and she may have had further experience than that.
Front Office Lady at DHS - Mrs. McGuffin who is the Front Office Lady at Discovery HS used to work at Liberty MS. I know her well because I used to go to the front office almost everyday to use the student phone and she would always give it to me when I showed up. Even during the student info meeting, she recognized a lot of students from our school.
